🌱 **What is Organic Farming?**

Organic farming is a method of growing crops and raising animals without synthetic chemicals like pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. It promotes ecological balance and aims to conserve biodiversity.

👩‍🌾 **Core Principles**:
• Maintain healthy soil through composting and crop rotation
• Avoid GMOs and harmful synthetic inputs
• Promote animal welfare and natural behavior
• Emphasize sustainability and resource conservation

🏙️ **Urban Relevance**:
Urban organic farming brings food production to rooftops, balconies, and small plots in cities. This empowers citizens to eat healthier, reduce carbon footprint, and reconnect with nature.

💡 **Did You Know?**
Over 90% of urban households can grow herbs and leafy vegetables with minimal effort — right on their balconies!

Soil is not just dirt — it’s a living system full of microbes, minerals, and life. But it’s in danger.

❌ **Main Pollutants**:
• Pesticides
• Heavy metals from industry
• Plastics and non-biodegradable waste
• Excessive chemical fertilizers

📉 **Effects**:
• Poor plant growth
• Contaminated food supply
• Polluted groundwater
• Soil infertility and erosion

✅ **Solutions**:
• Switch to compost and organic manure
• Grow native plants
• Stop using plastic mulching
• Educate your community

🌱 Growing even one plant in clean soil makes a difference.
